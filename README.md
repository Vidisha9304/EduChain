# EduChain
EduChain is a decentralized platform built on the Tezos blockchain for managing academic submissions and records. It enables students to submit assignments and projects securely while allowing teachers to track, grade, and store academic records in an immutable, transparent, and efficient manner.
By leveraging blockchain technology, EduChain ensures that all submissions and grades are stored permanently and tamper-proof. Smart contracts automate the processes of submission deadlines, grading, and penalties for late submissions, reducing the administrative burden on teachers. Students can receive NFT-based certificates and digital badges for project completion and achievements, which are recorded on the blockchain as verifiable credentials.
The platform also includes a peer review system where students can review each otherâ€™s work, incentivized with tokens. Privacy is ensured with encrypted records, accessible only by authorized users such as students and teachers. EduChain provides automated notifications for upcoming deadlines and new submissions.
By combining the power of blockchain with the needs of academic institutions, EduChain creates a transparent, secure, and efficient system for managing assignments and records, ensuring fairness and data integrity in the educational process.
